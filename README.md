# The 8 Square Puzzle
This puzzle sees a 3x3 square with numbers 1-8 in some random order with one blank spot, represented as a 0. The goal is to order the numbers by 'sliding' adjacent numbers into the blank space. The goal state can also be some other ordering of the values, but ascending is most common.
